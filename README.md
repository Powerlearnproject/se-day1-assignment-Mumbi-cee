Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing ,testing,and maintaining software
reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 digital transformation-enables business and goverments to depend on software engeering to modernize opreations
 efficient - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards of the software 
scalability- it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance of the software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
birth of software engineering-at this time software development faced challenges like cost overruns,delays, and unrealible systems.
rise of OOP-it revolutionized software design by promoting modularity,reusability and maintainability.
agile manifesto-it emphasized flexibility,collaboration,iterative development and customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identifirs the software requirement or purpose and of the software to be developed.
 requirement analysis - identifies the user needs and a document is created software requirement specifications(SRS). 
design - a blue print is cretaed for the system
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing -software undergoes testing to fix any bugs.
 maintance and support-software is maintained to fix bugs and update features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-waterfall-Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
-  Low flexibility
- changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
   Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts eg vscode
-code writing efficiency-provides syntax highlighting automation in good suggestions make including faster introducing areas
- debugging and error detection -has built-in debuggers to allow  step by step execution to identify and fix issues
- integrated compilation and execution- Ibe has compilers or interpreters allowing developers to build and run code within the same environment
  Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-managing complex codebases-as projects grow,maintaining and understanding large codebases becomes difficult-use version control system  to track changes
-Dealing with changing requirements- frequent changes in project scope can disrupt timelines and cause rework -use agile methodo to handle increased changes efficiently
- Debugging and fixing bugs -finding and fixing bugs can be done consuming and frustrating- use debugging tools and log analysis to pinpoint issues quickly
- Security vulnerabilities -software can be vulnerable to cyber threats in data breaches follow secure codeine practices and ensure encryption for sensitive data

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing- test individual components like functions classes or modules of a program that are written by developers
-Integration testing -verifies that multiple units work together as intended
-System testing- tests the entire application as a whole ensure that it meets  functional and nonfunctional requirements
      importance
-early bug detection- Unit and integration tests catches issues before they escalate
- Similar functionality system testing ensures that all components work together correctly
- Is the satisfaction acceptance guarantees the product meets user expectations
- Security and reliability ensures software is secure stable and performs efficiently under different conditions


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
       Importance
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
      vague prompte
- Create a report on a company performance
      improved prompt
  Create a five page report analyzing the companies financial report and operation performance for quater of 2024 include key metrics such as revenue profit margin customer growth and employee productivity use charts and graphs for data visualization and provide three recommendations for improvement
    importance of improved prompt
  -Clarity specifies the exact focus( financial and operations performance)
 - Specify defines key metrics Clearing state expectations without unnecessary details to be included like revenue profit margin
 - concise it clearly states expectations  without unncessary details
